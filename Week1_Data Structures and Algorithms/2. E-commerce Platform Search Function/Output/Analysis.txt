Big O Notation:
ğŸ”¸It is used to describe the performance (time or space complexity) of an algorithm in terms of input size (n). It helps compare algorithms efficiently.

Search Scenarios:
ğŸ”¸ Best Case: The shortest time the algorithm takes (e.g., first match in search).  
ğŸ”¸ Average Case: The expected time over all possible inputs.  
ğŸ”¸ Worst Case: The maximum time it takes (e.g., element not present).  

Search Time Complexities:

| Search Type       | Best Case | Average Case  | Worst Case  |
|------------------ |-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Linear Search     | O(1)      | O(n)          | O(n)        |
| Binary Search     | O(1)      | O(log n)      | O(log n)    |

Implemented Search Algorithms:
ğŸ”¸ Linear Search: Searches one by one in an unsorted array.  
ğŸ”¸ Binary Search: Searches in a sorted array using divide and conquer.  

Analysis:
ğŸ”¸ Linear Search Time Complexity: O(n)  
ğŸ”¸ Binary Search Time Complexity: O(log n)  

Most Suitable Algorithm:
ğŸ”¸ Binary Search is more suitable for large, sorted data because it significantly reduces the number of comparisons.  
ğŸ”¸ Linear Search is simpler and works on unsorted data but becomes inefficient as data size increases.
