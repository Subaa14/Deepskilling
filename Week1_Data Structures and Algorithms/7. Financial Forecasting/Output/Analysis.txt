Financial Forecasting

Recursive Algorithms:
ðŸ”¸ Recursion is a programming technique where a method calls itself to solve a smaller version of the same problem.
ðŸ”¸ It simplifies problems that can be broken down into similar subproblems, such as financial forecasting over time.

Setup:
ðŸ”¸ A recursive method is created to calculate the future value based on:
   â€¢ Current value
   â€¢ Annual growth rate
   â€¢ Number of years

Implementation:
ðŸ”¸ A recursive algorithm is used where:
   â€¢ Base Case: If years == 0, return the current value.
   â€¢ Recursive Case: Multiply the current value by (1 + growthRate) and call the method again with (years - 1).

Analysis:
ðŸ”¸ Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the number of years. Each recursive call handles one year.
ðŸ”¸ Optimization:
   â€¢ For large inputs, recursion can be optimized by converting to an iterative approach.
   â€¢ Memoization or dynamic programming can be used to store intermediate results and avoid repeated computation.
